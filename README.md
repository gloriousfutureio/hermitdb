# GitDB - Security First Datastore for User Focused Applications

GitDB aims to provide an encrypted at rest distributed database for apps which help users organize their life, think todo apps, password managers, contacts manager, quantified self applications.

We want to give users control over their data while maintaining the kinds of cross device syncing we have become accustomed to with centralized applications.

GitDB uses Git as the foundation for a distributed database, by using git we inherit all of the existing infrastructure built around managing git repositories (github, gitlab, etc.)

GitDB provides a set of data structures which attempt to make conflict resolution as painless as possible.
