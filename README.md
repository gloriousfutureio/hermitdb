# GitDB

###### A Security First Datastore for User Focused Applications

GitDB aims to provide an encrypted distributed database for offline first user focused apps. Think todo apps, password managers, etc.

Applications built using GitDB give users control over their data while maintaining the many of the conveniences of centralized applications.

By using Git we inherit:

1. a solid distributed foundation for our database

2. all existing infrastructure and tooling for managing Git repositories (github, gitlab, etc.)

On top of Git, GitDB adds encryption, a collection of CRDT data structures, and a Query interface.

## Design

Staying true to Git's roots, GitDB wraps a tree based key value store on top of a content addressable storage (CAS) core.

We add 4 concepts on top of Git: `Block`, `Path`, `TreeBlock` and `BlobBlock`. These are encrypted varients of the familiar Git concepts of the `Object`, `file path`, `Tree` and `Blob` respectively.

####Block

A `Block` is a single unit of data, `Block`'s are encrypted and stored on disk as a Git blob.

####Path

A `Path` is a unique name that maps to a `Block`.

######Path Format

`Path`'s begin with a `/` and are followed by zero or more *Path Components* interspersed with `/` .

*Path components* may contain any unicode charactor besides the special charactors, special charactors are `\` and `/`. To use a special charactor you'll need to prefix it with the escape charactor `\`.

*valid paths:* `/`,  `/a`, `/a/bb/ccc`, `/ /a\/b\\&$#/c `

*invalid paths:*

- ` ` : the empty path is invalid.
- `/a/ ` : paths can't end in a `/`.
- `/a//c` : paths can't have empty components.
- `/a\b` :  can't escape non-special charactors.

######Mapping a Path to a file on disk

To avoid leaking information about what is stored  on disk GitDB goes through a path obfuscation step before writing a file to disk.

An encrypted salt is stored at the root of the Git repository `./salt`.

```haskell
path <- "/a/b/c"
encrypted_salt <- os.fs.read("$GIT_ROOT/salt")
salt <- decrypt(secret_key, encrypted_salt) -- suppose salt == '$'
obf <- sha256(salt ++ path) -- => sha256("$/a/b/c")
-- => d61f774e6a38d6d9031ab6ccf281c6275a8f835b73134afc2f626a97bde0b87a
path_on_disk <- os.fs.path.join("$GIT_ROOT"), "cryptic", obf[0..2], obf[2..])
-- => $GIT_ROOT/cryptic/d6/1f774e6a38d6d9031ab6ccf281c6275a8f835b73134afc2f626a97bde0b87a
```

####TreeBlock

A `TreeBlock` is a `Block` that stores relationships between `Path`'s and `Block`'s. A `TreeBlock` stores entries of path's with a common prefix along with a flag telling us if this sub path is a `TreeBlock` or a `BlobBlock`.

ie. If we've got a `BlobBlock` in our DB with path `/a/b`, then:

 the root tree `/` will have an entry: `TREE: a`

the `/a` tree will have an entry: `BLOB: b`

#### BlobBlock

A `BlobBlock` is a block that appears in a `TreeBlock` with a `BLOB` flag. There's nothing else to differentiate a `BlobBlock` from another `Block`.

### A Worked Example

Suppose we've got two applications using the same GitDB database. `Mona: a password manager`, and `People: a contacts manager`.

At the root we've got two path's `/mona` and `/people`, beneath these namespaces, the apps store their data.

### Analysis of GitDB actions

#### `db.tree_block`

Opens the requested `TreeBlock`, creating if it does not exist

```
db.tree_block("/a/b")
```

**prior state:** `salt == "$"`, `TreeBlock(/a)`, `TreeBlock(/a/b)` do not exist, `TreeBlock(/)` exists.

1. `sha256("$/a/b") -> 03d4a92a45e0cddf2ec5a73efdd2582355d1df5ae80aae52f6b46d41f5607a4c`

2. convert hash to path on disk: `./cryptic/03/d4a92a45e0cddf2ec5a73efdd2582355d1df5ae80aae52f6b46d41f5607a4c`

3. attempt to decrypt this file, fails since it doesn't exist

4. recursively call  `let mut parent = db.tree_block("\a")`

5. add entry `b` to `/a` namespace: `parent.add_entry("b", TREE);`

6. create empty `TreeBlock`, encrypt and store on disk at:

    `./cryptic/03/d4a92a45e0cddf2ec5a73efdd2582355d1df5ae80aae52f6b46d41f5607a4c`

3. read file from disk: `let encrypted_blob = os.fs.read("./cryptic/d6/1f77...b87a")`
4. decrypt: `let blob = decrypt(secret_key, encrypted_blob)`

*Git repository is unchanged after call*

#### `rm`

```rust

```

### Crypto

#### Key Derivation

```haskell
key_file <- 256 bit key file fetched from local filesystem
key_salt <- fetch from gitdb -- random salt per key is stored in plaintext (here key refers to a GitDB key not an encryption key e.g. a GitDB key is a string like "/a/b/c")
iterations <- fetch from gitb (single iterations value for entire db)
master_passphrase <- read from users mind

pbkdf2_key <- PBKDF2(
  algo: SHA_256,
  pass: master_passphrase,
  salt: key_salt,
  iters: iterations,
  length: 256
)

key <- pbkdf2_key XOR key_file
```

#### Encryption

#####Avoiding Nonce Reuse (by not using nonces)

Since we are using an encryption algorithm who's nonce is 96bits, the nonce space is not large enough to give us confidence in random nonces.

Instead we use randomly generated 256bit salts as inputs to our kdf to give us unique encryption keys each time we encrypt. Salts are never reused.

Why is this done? Protecting against nonces reuse in a distributed system is difficult, for instance if we use naive incrementing nonces, we could enter a situation where two sites A and B both modify and re-encrypt the same file, both sites would increment the same nonce but they are encrypting (potentially) different plaintext, if we are not careful how we resolve this conflict we could end up with a key being exposed.

So as a workaround until our Rust crypto library of choice gets an XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation, we are opting for never reusing a secret key.

```haskell
gitdb_key <- USER INPUT  -- e.g. '/a/b/c')
plaintext <- USER INPUT

key_salt <- generate_random_salt -- random 256bit salt
persist_key_salt(gitdb_key, key_salt) -- overwrites old key_salt for this GitDB key

key <- generated as outlined in the Key Derivation section above

ciphertext <- AEAD(
  algo: CHACHA20_POLY1305
  secret_key: key,
  nonce: 0, -- random salts to give us unique secret_keys, we never encrypt with a key twice.
  ad: SHA_256(gitdb_key) | key_salt -- TODO: consider what data would be prudent to add
)
```
